    <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
       <p style="text-align:justify;">
            I’m Heather—a front-end developer with a background as colorful as my cross-stitch projects and as adventurous as a game night with friends. My journey started in education, 
            where I spent over a decade helping students overcome challenges and celebrating their growth. Today, I bring that same passion for problem-solving and creativity 
            to building accessible and engaging digital experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I’m not coding or streaming, you’ll probably find me deep into a game of <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>, rolling dice in a D&D campaign, 
            or modding my latest favorite video game. I also enjoy making tutorial videos on YouTube, sharing what I’ve learned with others. 
            Away from the screen, I love curling up with a good book—usually with one of my six cats keeping me company (three of whom I just couldn’t resist adopting as foster fails).
        </p>
         <p>
            My cats are constant reminders to stay curious, playful, and a little chaotic—qualities I happily bring into my work and hobbies alike.
            In every project I take on, whether building a website or crafting a new story for my D&D group, I find joy in creating experiences that bring people together.
