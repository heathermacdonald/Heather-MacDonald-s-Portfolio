    <p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">I am a front-end developer with a unique background in education, content creation, and 
    community management. With over a decade of experience as a special educator, I bring a strong 
    foundation in problem-solving, data analysis, and inclusive design to my work in technology.</justify> 
    </p>
    <p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
    My commitment to accessibility, honed through years of supporting diverse learners, drives me 
    to create digital experiences that are both engaging and inclusive for all users. I hold a CPACC 
    certification in accessibility and have completed comprehensive training in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
    Python, React, and other modern web technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
    In addition to my technical expertise, I have built and nurtured a thriving online community 
    across Twitch, YouTube, TikTok, and Discord. With 1,679 Twitch followers and 62K total watch hours, 
    I have created engaging content that has brought people together while raising over $3,800 for 
    charitable causes. Managing this community has strengthened my skills in project management, 
    digital marketing, and audience engagement, all of which translate directly into building 
    user-centered digital experiences.
    </p>  
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
    My diverse background sets me apart as a developer who values creativity, inclusivity, and 
    accessibility. I am passionate about using my technical skills and educational expertise to 
    solve complex problems and design web experiences that welcome every user. I am excited to 
    bring my unique perspective to a forward-thinking team that values accessibility, innovation, 
    and inclusive design.
